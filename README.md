# DistYOLOv11
This repository is an extension of the Ultralytics YOLOv11 model. It provides spatial uncertainty estimates of the bounding box predicted by YOLOv11 using a discrete probability distribution.

Users familiar with the YOLOv11 model should be able to use DistYOLO in the same way familiar to them already. Detailed documentation on DistYOLOv11 is to come!
